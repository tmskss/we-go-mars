# Grand Challenges in Radiation Shielding for Crewed Mars Missions

Human missions to Mars must contend with a radiation environment that exceeds current shielding capabilities. This document distills the most difficult technological hurdles identified across NASA, ESA, CNSA, Roscosmos, JAXA, CSA, and ISRO roadmaps.

## 1. Galactic Cosmic Ray Mitigation

- Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) include high-energy heavy ions (HZE) that require tens of g·cm⁻² of hydrogen-rich material to reduce dose-equivalent to acceptable levels.
- Launch mass and volume constraints make such thick shielding impractical for transit vehicles, forcing heavy reliance on mission trajectory optimization and operational exposure management.

## 2. Secondary Radiation Management

- Dense materials (aluminum, steel) and even moderate hydrogen-rich layers can produce secondary neutrons and gamma rays when struck by HZE particles.
- No currently qualified, lightweight structural material achieves substantial GCR attenuation without significant secondary particle production, leaving a major materials science gap.

## 3. In-Situ Resource Utilization for Surface Shielding

- Mars surface habitats depend on regolith berms or water/ice structures for long-duration protection, yet excavation, transport, and structural fabrication systems remain unproven in Martian conditions.
- Validating regolith-derived shielding requires autonomous construction technologies, dust-mitigation strategies, and long-term structural testing never before demonstrated off Earth.

## 4. Low-TRL Active or Hybrid Shielding

- Magnetic or electrostatic shielding concepts promise mass savings but face unresolved issues in superconducting magnet mass, cryogenic power, radiation-induced quenching, and system reliability.
- Hybrid systems that combine active fields with passive materials remain at TRL 2–3 despite decades of study, with no near-term flight demonstrations scheduled.

## 5. Biological Risk Uncertainties

- Epidemiological and radiobiological models for chronic HZE exposure have large uncertainty bands, forcing conservative dose limits that drive up shielding requirements.
- Continuous updates from accelerator studies and spaceflight dosimetry are needed to tighten risk projections, yet current data are insufficient to significantly relax design margins.

These challenges collectively imply that Mars mission shielding solutions must integrate advances in materials science, construction robotics, mission operations, and biomedical research. Cross-agency collaboration remains essential to close technology gaps before committing crews to multi-year deep-space missions.
