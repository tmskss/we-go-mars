# Canadian Space Agency Radiation Shielding Initiatives

This document details Canadian Space Agency (CSA) procurement activities and research programs related to radiation shielding and dosimetry for human exploration through late 2024. Canada focuses on niche capabilities—dosimetry instrumentation, health countermeasures, and robotics integration—often in partnership with NASA and ESA.

## 1. Programme Structure and Funding Mechanisms

- **Exploration / Robotics and Health Directorate:** Oversees contributions to lunar and deep-space missions.
- **Health Beyond Initiative:** Multi-year program advancing remote healthcare and crew health technologies, including radiation risk mitigation.
- **Announcements of Opportunity (AO):** CSA issues AOs for academia and industry (e.g., "Deep Space Healthcare Challenge," "Health Beyond - Phase 0 Study").
- **Grants & Contributions:** Provide smaller awards (<CAD 500k) for feasibility studies, often co-funded by the National Research Council (NRC) or Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).
- **Industrial Partnerships:** CSA collaborates with Canadian SMEs such as Bubble Technology Industries (BTI), Honeywell Canada, and COM DEV (Honeywell) for dosimetry and electronics.

## 2. Completed and Ongoing Projects

### 2.1 DOSI / Radi-N Bubble Detector Program

- **Partners:** CSA, BTI, NASA.
- **Scope:** Deploy bubble detectors aboard the ISS to measure neutron dose rates; provides data for validating shielding models and calibrating other detectors.
- **Results:** Multiple campaigns (Radi-N1 to Radi-N4) spanning 2012–2023 generated neutron dose maps for the ISS, informing storm shelter planning and contributing to NASA’s SRAG analyses.

### 2.2 Matroshka Experiment Contributions

- **Role:** CSA participated in DLR-led Matroshka campaigns, supplying dosimeters and data analysis support. Results feed into Canada’s radiobiology research and support future Artemis missions.

### 2.3 Health Beyond Phase 0 Studies

- **AO:** 2020–2021 call for concepts addressing deep-space healthcare.
- **Relevant Awards:** 
  - Bubble Technology Industries: "Miniaturized Mixed-Field Radiation Monitor" feasibility study.
  - Canadensys Aerospace: "Lunar Habitat Radiation Environment Sensor Network" concept.
- **Outcome:** Studies informed subsequent Phase A opportunities and integration with Gateway/Artemis missions.

### 2.4 Lunar Gateway Contributions (Canadarm3)

- **Radiation Relevance:** While Canadarm3 focuses on robotics, CSA is funding associated environmental monitoring packages to support robotic operations and safeguard electronics. Phase 0/Phase A studies include shielding requirements for the robotic base station.

### 2.5 Canadian Space Health Research

- **Programs:** NSERC/CSA joint grants on radiobiology, e.g., McGill University’s “DNA Repair Pathways in Deep-Space Radiation Environments.”
- **Deliverables:** Provide data linking radiation exposure to health outcomes, supporting shielding requirements and medical protocols.

## 3. Current Solicitations and Near-Term Plans

### 3.1 Health Beyond Phase A Procurement (2024)

- **Scope:** Detailed design of medical and radiation monitoring systems for Gateway and Artemis surface missions.
- **Targets:** Develop flight-ready prototypes of compact dosimeters and integrate with telemedicine platforms; aim for deployment during Gateway early crewed missions.
- **Status:** Request for Proposals released June 2024; contract awards expected early 2025 for 24–30 month performance.

### 3.2 Lunar Surface Exploration Initiative (LSEI)

- **Objective:** Support Canadian contributions to lunar surface infrastructure (rover, habitation technologies).
- **Radiation Focus:** Studies on regolith shielding for rover safe havens and portable shelters; AECL and CSA are evaluating hydrogen-rich composite panels for rover cabins.
- **Procurement:** Industrial capability studies initiated under the 2023 LSEI AO; follow-on Phase A/B contracts anticipated 2025.

### 3.3 Collaboration with NASA/ESA

- **Gateway Dosimetry Package:** CSA exploring joint development with NASA’s SRAG for a Canadian-led neutron spectrometer for Gateway.
- **ESA Partnerships:** Potential involvement in ESA’s regolith shielding demonstrations via joint workshops and shared data.

## 4. Strategic Trends

- **Dosimetry Expertise:** Canada leverages BTI’s bubble detector technology and NRC’s metrology facilities to remain a world leader in neutron dosimetry.
- **SME Engagement:** AOs encourage participation from Canadian SMEs, aligning with Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) goals.
- **Integration with Robotics:** Shielding considerations extend to protecting robotic systems (Canadarm3 electronics) and providing emergency safe zones for crew servicing tasks.
- **Health-Centric Focus:** Projects merge shielding with medical monitoring, reflecting Canada’s niche in space health research.
