# Programmatic Specification

## 1. Lifecycle Alignment

- **Phase 0/A (Concept):** Define mission scenarios, perform initial radiation trades, identify technology gaps.
- **Phase B (Preliminary Design):** Mature requirements, complete shielding trades, plan verification campaigns.
- **Phase C (Detailed Design):** Finalize shielding layouts, procure materials, prepare test hardware.
- **Phase D (Manufacturing & Test):** Fabricate components, execute beamline tests, integrate systems.
- **Phase E (Operations):** Conduct mission operations, monitor radiation environment, execute contingency procedures.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Level 1: Radiation Protection System
  - Level 2a: Structural Shielding
  - Level 2b: Consumables Integration
  - Level 2c: Dosimetry & Monitoring
  - Level 2d: Regolith Infrastructure
  - Level 2e: Verification & Testing
  - Level 2f: Operations & Training

## 3. Schedule Integration

- Include radiation milestones in Integrated Master Schedule:
  - Requirement freeze (Phase B).
  - Preliminary analysis complete.
  - Beamline test campaigns.
  - Storm shelter mockup build/test.
  - Regolith demo completion.
  - Final analysis closeouts before CDR.
  - ORR/FRR radiation readiness review.

## 4. Resource Planning

- **Budget:** Allocate funds for analysis tools, beamline tests (NSRL/HIMAC), shielding materials, regolith equipment.
- **Personnel:** Systems engineers, radiation analysts, materials scientists, operations planners; ensure cross-discipline staffing.
- **Facilities:** CAD/analysis infrastructure, integration facilities, radiation test labs, analog test sites.

## 5. Partnership Coordination

- Establish Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with agencies/industry for data sharing and test facility access.
- Coordinate with commercial partners (SpaceX, industry primes) to embed shielding requirements in contracts.
- Manage joint review boards with partner agencies to ensure standard alignment.

## 6. Documentation and Configuration Control

- Maintain Radiation Protection Plan, Analysis Reports, Test Plans, and Risk Register in controlled repository.
- Use Configuration Control Board to approve changes; document rationale and impact analysis.
- Conduct periodic audits to ensure documentation compliance with agency policy.

## 7. Funding and Policy Considerations

- Track government appropriations (NASA, ESA, partner agencies) impacting shielding scope.
- Prepare advocacy materials demonstrating risk reduction to secure funding.
- Monitor regulatory frameworks (nuclear power usage, launch safety) influencing shielding approaches.
