# Verification and Validation Specification

## 1. Verification Planning

- Develop Verification & Validation Matrix (VVM) mapping requirements to methods (analysis, test, inspection, demonstration).
- Assign responsible organizations (structures, ECLSS, avionics, operations).
- Define entry/exit criteria for each verification event.
- Align verification schedule with lifecycle milestones (SRR → PDR → CDR → ORR/FRR).

## 2. Analysis Verification

- **Radiation Transport:** Provide signed analysis reports demonstrating compliance with dose limits, using validated environment scenarios.
- **Mass Properties:** Verify shielding mass distribution using mass property audits; confirm against CAD models.
- **Operational Analysis:** Validate EVA schedules and shelter activation timelines via simulation.

## 3. Test Verification

- **Material Testing:** Beamline exposure of shielding coupons to confirm attenuation vs. model predictions.
- **Storm Shelter Mockup:** Full-scale shelter test with dosimeters and simulated SPE spectrum; validate shielding factor and habitability parameters.
- **Electronics Hardness:** Heavy-ion/proton testing of critical avionics; single-event effect characterization.
- **Dosimetry System:** Functional tests verifying latency, redundancy, and data integrity; calibration against reference sources.

## 4. Inspection and Demonstration

- **Installation Checks:** Inspect shielding panels, water bladders, and regolith coverage for continuity and thickness.
- **Operational Drills:** Conduct crew shelter drills and EVA abort simulations; evaluate timing and procedural compliance.
- **Surface Construction:** Demonstrate robotic regolith movement and berm formation at analog site.

## 5. Validation Activities

- **Integrated Mission Simulations:** Run end-to-end mission scenarios combining trajectory, environment, and operations to validate that mitigations meet mission goals.
- **Flight Demonstrators:** Deploy shielding technology on precursor missions (e.g., Gateway modules, lunar habitats) for heritage data.
- **Post-Flight Analysis:** Compare actual dosimetry data with predictions; update models for future certification.

## 6. Documentation and Reviews

- Maintain Verification Evidence Reports (VERs) summarizing results, deviations, and closures.
- Track open items via action item list; resolve prior to certification.
- Present verification status at design reviews; obtain stakeholder concurrence at CDR and ORR/FRR.

## 7. Configuration Control

- Any change affecting shielding design triggers update to VVM and relevant verification plans.
- Archive test data, analysis results, and configuration snapshots for audit and future missions.
