# Risk Management Specification

## 1. Risk Identification

- Conduct hazard analyses (PHA, FHA) focusing on radiation exposure and shielding performance.
- Identify failure modes:
  - Insufficient shielding material delivery.
  - Unexpected SPE intensity beyond design.
  - Regolith construction failure.
  - Dosimetry system outage.
  - Avionics upset cascade.

## 2. Risk Assessment

- Use probability × consequence matrix aligned with agency policy (e.g., NASA 5×5).
- Categorize risks: high, medium, low; prioritize mitigation for high and medium.
- Evaluate residual risk after mitigation; ensure within acceptable thresholds.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Shielding shortfall | Maintain mass margin, pre-position backup consumables, modular add-on panels. |
| Extreme SPE | Develop contingency shelter mass (water repositioning), adjust mission timeline, have abort options. |
| Regolith system failure | Include redundant excavators, pre-integrated shielding, manual crew-assisted methods. |
| Dosimetry outage | Provide redundant sensors, backup data links, manual dosimeters. |
| Avionics SEU cascade | Hardened electronics, redundant controllers, safe-mode procedures. |

## 4. Risk Monitoring

- Maintain risk register with owner, mitigation steps, next review date.
- Update risk status at monthly program meetings and major milestones.
- Implement leading indicators (e.g., consumable mass depletion) to anticipate risk elevation.

## 5. Contingency Planning

- Develop contingency procedures for high-impact risks (e.g., shelter-in-place longer than design, partial shielding failure).
- Allocate contingency resources (mass, power, schedule) to execute mitigations.
- Ensure crew training covers contingency operations.

## 6. Lessons Learned Integration

- Incorporate data from past missions (Mars Odyssey SPE response, MER SEUs) into risk models.
- Review NASA/ESA risk databases for relevant findings.
- After each major test or mission, capture lessons and feed back into risk register.

## 7. Reporting

- Submit risk reports to Program Control Board; include trend analysis.
- For joint missions, share risk summaries with partner agencies to coordinate mitigations.
