# Operations and Sustainment Specification

## 1. Mission Operations Concept

- **Radiation Monitoring:** Continuous dosimetry via networked sensors, personal badges, and automated data uplink to mission control.
- **Alert Procedures:** Automatic alert thresholds (dose rate >0.5 mSv·h⁻¹, SPE detection) trigger auditory/visual cues, flight software alerts, and ground notifications.
- **Shelter Protocol:** Crew proceeds to storm shelter within 15 minutes; system locks down non-essential equipment, configures ECLSS for closed-loop operation.
- **EVA Management:** Pre-EVA radiation brief; real-time monitoring; abort thresholds; rovers positioned as safe havens.
- **Consumable Repositioning:** Periodic review of shielding mass distribution; reposition water/consumables if design envelope threatened.

## 2. Surface Operations

- **Regolith Berm Maintenance:** Scheduled inspections, thermal cycling checks, reinforcement with sintering or mesh.
- **Water/Ice Handling:** Maintain thermal control to prevent phase change, monitor for leaks, and reprocess waste water into shielding reservoirs.
- **Dust Mitigation:** Use coatings or mechanical removal to prevent dust infiltration into shielding layers and vents.
- **Power Management:** Ensure storm shelter and excavation systems have dedicated power reserves (battery/fission backup).

## 3. Training and Procedures

- **Crew Training:** Radiation physics basics, dosimetry usage, shelter drills, EVA aborts, regolith equipment operation.
- **Ground Team Training:** Data interpretation, forecast analysis, anomaly response coordination.
- **Simulations:** Regular tabletop exercises and integrated mission simulations for radiation contingencies.

## 4. Sustainment Strategy

- **Logistics:** Track consumable inventory; plan resupply missions to replenish shielding mass (water, polymer tiles).
- **Maintenance:** Inspect shielding hardware, replace damaged panels/bladders, recalibrate dosimeters.
- **Data Archival:** Store radiation telemetry, shelter usage logs, EVA dosimetry for future analysis.

## 5. Post-Mission Activities

- Gather dosimetry devices for detailed analysis; correlate with crew medical data.
- Update radiation models with actual mission data; revise requirements and procedures.
- Document lessons learned; feed into subsequent mission planning cycles.

## 6. Disposal and Decommissioning

- Plan for safe disposal or repurposing of shielding materials at end-of-life (e.g., bury regolith structures, recycle water).
- Ensure residual radioactive contamination (if any from power units) handled per regulations.
