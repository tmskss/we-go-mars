# ESA Radiation Shielding Tenders: History and Current Opportunities

This dossier consolidates information on European Space Agency (ESA) procurement activities related to radiation shielding for human exploration missions. It is based on ESA public tender documentation, programme roadmaps, and contractor reports available up to late 2024. Where contract numbers or budgets are approximate, they are noted as such. Users should confirm details with the ESA Tender Action Tool (ESA-Star) for the latest authoritative data.

## 1. Procurement Channels Relevant to Radiation Shielding

- **Discovery & Preparation (D&P) Programme:** Early-stage feasibility studies (Phase 0/A) investigating mission concepts, technologies, and systems. D&P contracts typically range from €150k–€500k and last 12–18 months.
- **General Support Technology Programme (GSTP):** Technology maturation to TRL 4–6, including breadboard development and lab demonstrations. Budgets often span €1–4M with 24–36 month schedules.
