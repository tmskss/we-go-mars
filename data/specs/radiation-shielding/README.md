# Radiation Shielding Specification

Main points for planning radiation protection for a **crewed Mars journey** (cruise + surface stay + return):

## 1. Define Radiation Limits + Dose Budget

* Set mission dose targets based on accepted risk (career + mission limits).
* NASA's current career exposure limit is **~600 mSv** (effective dose) for astronauts. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][1])

## 2. Model the Radiation Environment (What You Must Survive)

* Two main hazards:

  * **Solar Particle Events (SPEs):** short, intense "storms" (hours–days).
  * **Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR):** constant, penetrating background (months–years).
* Mission planning needs **worst-case SPE scenarios** + realistic GCR predictions.

## 3. Minimize Time "Unshielded"

* The best protection is **shorter exposure time**:

  * Faster transit trajectories / higher-energy propulsion options
  * Avoid long loiter phases in deep space
* This directly reduces integrated GCR dose.

## 4. Design Passive Shielding Around Crew Living Areas

* Use **hydrogen-rich materials** (best mass-efficiency vs space radiation):

  * water, food, plastics like polyethylene
* "Smart shielding" = **put mass where people already are**, not everywhere.

## 5. Build a Dedicated "Storm Shelter" for Solar Events

* A small, heavily shielded safe room for SPE alerts.
* Practical concept: **store water and supplies around it** to boost shielding. ([NASA][2])

## 6. Radiation Monitoring + Space-Weather Forecasting + Procedures

* Continuous **dosimeters** on crew + in spacecraft zones
* Automatic alerting, rapid move-to-shelter drills, EVA abort rules

## 7. Surface Habitat Shielding (Mars Stay is Long)

* Use Mars materials for bulk shielding:

  * **regolith cover**, berms, or partially buried habitats
* Modern concepts include **water-rich / clay regolith structures** (even 3D-printable slurries). ([European Space Agency][3])

## 8. Operational Rules (EVA is the Riskiest Activity)

* Minimize EVAs, shorten durations, schedule when risk is lower
* Provide **shielded rover** safe zones and rapid-return plans

## 9. Medical / Biological Countermeasures

* Health monitoring (blood markers, immune function, cardiovascular/neuro effects)
* Consider radioprotective drugs/nutrition strategies as a *secondary layer* (not a substitute for shielding)

## 10. Verification & Validation (Before Committing Humans)

* End-to-end simulation: radiation transport (incl. secondary particles), mission timeline, procedures
* Use real space measurements to calibrate models (e.g., RAD instrument data)

## Key Reality Check

* **SPEs are "shieldable"** with a storm shelter and operations.
* **GCR is harder**: very energetic particles penetrate deeply, and too much dense shielding can create **secondary radiation**. That's why Mars plans focus on:
  **(1) time reduction + (2) smart hydrogen-rich shielding + (3) operational constraints.**
