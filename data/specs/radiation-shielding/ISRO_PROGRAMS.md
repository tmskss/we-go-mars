# ISRO Radiation Shielding Activities and Procurement Landscape

This document summarizes initiatives by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) related to radiation shielding and dosimetry in support of human spaceflight (Gaganyaan), lunar exploration, and deep-space missions through late 2024.

## 1. Institutional Framework

- **Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC):** Established in 2019 to manage Gaganyaan crewed missions, including crew module design, environmental control, and radiation protection.
- **Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC):** Leads launch vehicle integration and structural design, including shielding analyses for the crew module and service module.
- **Space Applications Centre (SAC) & Physical Research Laboratory (PRL):** Develop space environment sensors and dosimetry instrumentation.
- **Funding Mechanisms:** ISRO issues tenders via the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) and ISRO Vendor portals; collaborates with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and academic institutions through RESPOND and Technology Development Programme (TDP) grants.

## 2. Completed and Ongoing Projects

### 2.1 Gaganyaan Crew Module Shielding

- **Scope:** Design of multilayer aluminum alloy structure, phenolic ablative heat shield, and localized polyethylene liners around crew seats and avionics.
- **Partners:** VSSC, HSFC, and DRDO laboratories (INMAS) for radiobiology; external support from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for materials testing.
- **Status:** Uncrewed test flight (2023 TV-D1) validated structural design; ongoing human-rating tests include radiation environment assessments using GEANT4/MCNP simulations and dosimetry instrumentation.

### 2.2 Space Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) Payloads

- **Developers:** SAC and PRL.
- **Deployments:** Chandrayaan-1 (2008) carried the Radiation Dose Monitor (RADOM) developed with Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Chandrayaan-3 lander hosted the ChaSTE-Langmuir probe with radiation data integration. Upcoming missions plan upgraded dosimeters for lunar orbit and surface.

### 2.3 RESPOND/TDP Grants on Shielding Materials

- **Projects:** 
  - IIT Madras: "Hybrid Polymer Composites for Space Radiation Mitigation" (2020–2022).
  - Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC): "High Density Polyethylene-Boron Carbide Panels for Crew Module Applications."
- **Outcomes:** Developed composite panels demonstrating 15–20% improvement in dose-equivalent reduction over aluminum; results feed into HSFC material down-select.

### 2.4 Anveshika and Space Biology Research

- **Program:** ISRO's Space Biology roadmap (2022) includes radiation biology experiments at the Ramaiah Institute and DRDO labs to understand cellular responses relevant to shielding design.

## 3. Current and Planned Activities

### 3.1 Gaganyaan Phase 2 (Sustained Human Presence)

- **Goal:** Post-initial crewed flights, ISRO targets a modular space station in low Earth orbit (announced 2023) requiring enhanced shielding for 20-day missions.
- **Procurement:** HSFC exploring collaborations with Indian industry for advanced materials, storm shelter concepts, and distributed dosimetry. RFPs expected following 2025 mission milestones.

### 3.2 Chandrayaan-4 / Lunar Sample Return (Concept)

- **Status:** Feasibility studies underway; shielding requirements include protection for sample-return capsule and potential lunar infrastructure.
- **Research Needs:** Regolith shielding studies, water-ice utilization at the lunar south pole; ISRO pursuing joint research with JAXA under the Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) mission.

### 3.3 LUPEX Mission

- **Partners:** JAXA (lander) and ISRO (rover).
- **Radiation Components:** Rover expected to carry dosimetry payloads co-developed with SAC and Japanese partners; contributes to understanding lunar surface radiation for future habitats.

### 3.4 Academic Collaborations

- **RESPOND 2024 Call:** Emphasizes human spaceflight topics, including radiation shielding and monitoring. Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), IISc, and AIIMS are active participants.
- **International Cooperation:** Discussions with NASA and ESA for data exchange on dosimetry and materials; participation in workshops such as the International Space Radiation Research Summit.

## 4. Trends and Considerations

- **Domestic Industrialization:** ISRO encourages Indian SMEs to develop radiation monitoring hardware and composite materials, aligning with “Make in India” policy.
- **Regulation and Standards:** HSFC adapting NASA/ESA standards to Indian context; working to establish national guidelines for crew dose limits (targeting ≤150 mSv per mission for early flights).
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Heavy-ion irradiations conducted at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) Kolkata and BARC facilities; plans for dedicated space radiation test facility under TDP.
- **Operational Focus:** Combining physical shielding with mission planning (short-duration missions, timely re-entry) while long-term habitats remain in early design stages.

## 5. Monitoring Opportunities

1. **ISRO Procurement Portal / GeM:** Filter tenders by “radiation shielding,” “dosimetry,” or “Gaganyaan.”
2. **HSFC Updates:** Press briefings and technical conferences (e.g., Human Spaceflight & Exploration Symposium) highlight upcoming needs.
3. **RESPOND/TDP Announcements:** Published on ISRO website; proposals typically solicited annually.
4. **Academic Conferences:** ISRO-sponsored conferences (e.g., “Aerospace Medicine & Allied Sciences”) reveal ongoing collaborations.
