# CNSA Radiation Shielding Initiatives: Procurement and Research Landscape

This document surveys radiation shielding activities associated with the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). Information is drawn from publicly available announcements, academic publications, and state-owned enterprise reports through late 2024. Because many Chinese procurements are not openly competed internationally, several details are inferred from program summaries and national research funding announcements.

## 1. Institutional Framework

- **Governing Bodies:** CNSA oversees civilian space missions, while CMSA manages human spaceflight (Tiangong space station, crewed lunar program). Both coordinate with the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND).
- **Industrial Base:** Core contractors include the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC). Subsidiaries such as the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) and China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) deliver crewed module structures and propulsion segments with integrated shielding.
- **Research Funding:** Radiation protection research often appears under the National Key R&D Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), and CAS Strategic Priority Programs (e.g., “Space Environment and Effects”).
- **Procurement Channels:** Competitive tenders occasionally surface on the China Government Procurement Network (http://www.ccgp.gov.cn) or the CASC Supplier Portal, but many shielding tasks are awarded through directed contracts to state-owned institutes.

## 2. Completed / Ongoing Projects

### 2.1 Tiangong Space Station Shielding Upgrades

- **Contractors:** CAST, Beijing Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering (BISSE), Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of CAS for material testing.
- **Scope:** Design multilayer shielding combining aluminum alloy pressure shells, polyethylene liners, and water storage for crew sleep stations. Incorporates High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) and active dosimetry (e.g., MDU-1). 
- **Results:** Demonstrated crew-equivalent dose rates of 0.30–0.36 mSv·day⁻¹ in low Earth orbit, with secondary radiation analysis published in *Chinese Journal of Space Science* (2022). Data used to benchmark GCR mitigation for future deep space missions.

### 2.2 Lunar Gateway Component Studies (Chinese Crewed Lunar Program)

- **Programme:** “921 Project” extension targeting crewed lunar landing by 2030.
- **Shielding Objectives:** Develop crewed spacecraft (Next-Generation Manned Spacecraft) and lunar surface habitat modules with hydrogen-rich composite liners and regolith utilization concepts.
- **Research Activities:** Reports from the 2023 China Space Conference cite CASC 5th Academy projects on water-based multifunctional shielding, with material tests at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Lanzhou (HIMAC-L). 
- **Status:** Engineering development phase; full-scale qualification pending mission confirmation.

### 2.3 Deep Space Radiation Environment Observatory Payloads

- **Missions:** Chang’e-4, Chang’e-6, Tianwen-1 carried Lunar Lander Neutron and Dosimetry (LND) instruments and Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer.
- **Deliverables:** Produced long-duration surface radiation data (e.g., LND measured 1.315 mSv·day⁻¹ on the lunar far side). Findings feed into CNSA shielding design reference missions and model validation.

### 2.4 National Key Project: Advanced Space Radiation Protection Materials

- **Funding:** National Key R&D Program (2019–2023), coordinated by Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials (BIAM) and CAS.
- **Focus:** Develop hydrogenated boron nitride nanotube composites, aerogels infused with boron, and regolith-polymer simulants. 
- **Outcome:** Achieved 20–30% dose-equivalent reduction in heavy-ion testing at IMP-Lanzhou compared with aluminum references; materials slated for further integration studies under CMSA.

## 3. Current Research and Near-Term Opportunities (2024 Onward)

### 3.1 CMSA Crewed Lunar Mission Demonstrators

- **Plan:** Solicit subsystem prototypes for lunar surface shelter, storm shelter pods aboard the new crewed spacecraft, and logistics modules. While formal tenders are limited, CMSA has issued internal Requests for Proposals to CASC/CASIC subsidiaries emphasizing hydrogen-rich materials and mass-efficient regolith structures.
- **Targets:** Demonstrate TRL 5 shielding modules by 2026 to support uncrewed surface tests.

### 3.2 Space Station Upgrade Packages

- **Objective:** Integrate distributed dosimetry network (solid-state spectrometers, water-based shielding) for extended Tiangong operations (>2035).
- **Procurement:** CAST and Harbin Institute of Technology leading technology maturation; academic partners funded through NSFC key projects (grant series 1227xxxx).

### 3.3 International Collaboration

- **BRICS Framework:** Discussions on cooperative radiation research with Roscosmos and ISRO, focusing on shared data from lunar/planetary missions.
- **UN COPUOS & APSCO:** Multilateral platforms where CNSA offers joint research opportunities—e.g., APSCO cubesat missions with radiation payloads.

## 4. Trends and Strategic Considerations

- **Integrated Design:** Shielding is embedded within multifunctional mass (water tanks, logistics) consistent with mass constraints of Long March launchers.
- **Regolith Utilization:** Emphasis on in-situ resource utilization for lunar surface bases, including microwave sintering and sulfur-concrete composites.
- **Limited Transparency:** External companies face barriers to participating in CNSA procurements; partnerships typically require collaboration with Chinese institutes.
- **Data Sharing:** CNSA increasingly releases radiation datasets (e.g., LND, Tianwen-1) post-mission, enabling broader academic research.

## 5. Tracking Future Developments

1. **CNSA / CMSA Press Releases:** Monitor official channels and events such as the Zhuhai Airshow and China Space Conference for programme updates.
2. **National Key R&D Announcements:** Ministry of Science and Technology publishes annual project lists that reveal material and shielding research awards.
3. **Academic Journals:** *Journal of Astronautics*, *Chinese Journal of Space Science*, and *Acta Astronautica Sinica* frequently outline technological progress.
4. **State-Owned Enterprise Reports:** CASC annual reports and shareholder briefings mention major technology contracts and milestones.
