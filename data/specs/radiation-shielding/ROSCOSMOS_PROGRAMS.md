# Roscosmos Radiation Shielding Programmes and Procurements

This document summarizes Russian (Roscosmos) activities related to radiation shielding for human spaceflight and deep-space missions. Information is based on Federal Space Program documents, procurement notices on zakupki.gov.ru, and reports from key institutes through late 2024.

## 1. Institutional and Procurement Structure

- **Federal Space Program (FSP) 2021–2030:** Defines national priorities, including development of the Oryol crewed spacecraft, Lunar base concepts (Luna-Glob, Luna-Resurs), and deep-space habitats—all requiring enhanced radiation protection.
- **Key Institutes and Contractors:**
  - RSC Energia (Oryol spacecraft, orbital modules).
  - TsNIIMash (central research institute for system design and standards).
  - Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) for human factors and biomedicine.
  - Keldysh Research Center and Moscow Aviation Institute for shielding materials research.
  - Rosatom subsidiaries (e.g., NIKIMT) for radiation material science.
- **Procurement Channels:** State contracts posted on zakupki.gov.ru under Roscosmos and enterprises. Many strategic tasks proceed via closed tenders due to defense-related content.

## 2. Historical and Completed Projects

### 2.1 Oryol (PTK NP) Crew Vehicle Shielding Development

- **Timeline:** Initial contracts awarded 2016–2024.
- **Scope:** Design shielding for lunar-capable crew capsule; includes multilayer aluminum-lithium hull, polyethylene liners, and seat-mounted storm shelter provisions.
- **Results:** 2023 TsNIIMash report cites compliance with 500 mSv per mission limit under lunar flyby DRM, using updated GEANT4-based modeling tools (GRAZIA code).

### 2.2 ISS-Based Experiments (Matroshka-R, BION-M)

- **Matroshka-R:** Collaboration with DLR; phantom torso containing dosimeters installed externally and internally on the ISS, generating tissue-equivalent dose data for Russian EVA suits and habitat shielding (2004–2015).
- **BION-M1 (2013):** Carried dosimetry packages to study biological effects of deep-space-like exposure; results feed into IBMP radiobiological models for lunar missions.

### 2.3 Luna-Resurs Habitat Concept Studies

- **Contracts:** Energiya and IKI RAS led studies (2014–2019) on lunar surface infrastructure. Shielding elements explored regolith berms, water storage, and inflatable storm shelters.
- **Deliverables:** Preliminary designs for 1–1.5 m regolith shielding equivalent, mass budgets, and plans for in-situ regolith moving systems.

### 2.4 Active Shielding Research

- **Program:** "Nuclon" interplanetary mission concept by Roscosmos and Rosatom (2010s) included superconducting magnet shielding feasibility. Research undertaken by Kurchatov Institute and MEPhI; results showed prohibitive mass but identified hybrid concepts for future study.

## 3. Current Activities and Tenders

### 3.1 Oryol Qualification Phase

- **Status:** Hardware development ongoing at RSC Energia; shielding verification includes ground test modules and simulated GCR/SPE exposure using synchrotron facilities (e.g., NPI Tomsk).
- **Expected Deliverables:** Qualification reports demonstrating compliance with lunar orbit mission requirements by 2026.

### 3.2 Lunar Orbital Station (ROSS) and Surface Base Studies

- **Scope:** Roscosmos planning for the Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) includes high-latitude orbits with increased radiation exposure. Research contracts awarded to TsNIIMash and Energia (2021–2024) to evaluate shielding, storm shelters, and occupational procedures.
- **Lunar Base:** Joint projects with China (ILRS) include shielding trade studies—though details remain limited; Russian contributions focus on regolith construction equipment and water-based shielding modules.

### 3.3 IBMP Radiobiology Initiatives

- **Projects:** Ongoing experiments "SIRIUS" isolation campaigns and ground-based irradiation studies to refine career dose models; funded via Roscosmos research grants and the Russian Science Foundation.
- **Instrumentation:** Development of compact neutron dosimeters with Rosatom, targeted for Oryol and future habitats.

### 3.4 Public Tenders (Recent)

- **zakupki.gov.ru ID 32111457354 (2023):** Contract for "Development of radiation protection design documentation for specialized modules of ROSS" awarded to TsNIIMash.
- **zakupki.gov.ru ID 32211888906 (2024):** Procurement of polyethylene-based shielding panels for ISS Russian segment upgrades, contractor NPP Himmash (indicative data).

## 4. Trends and Challenges

- **Budget Constraints:** Economic pressures slow development timelines; shielding R&D often bundled with broader habitat contracts to secure funding.
- **International Collaboration:** Sanctions limit cooperation with Western agencies; partnerships with CNSA and BRICS members provide alternative avenues.
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Russia leverages synchrotron and proton beam facilities (JINR Dubna, MEPhI) but continues to invest in new heavy-ion sources to match NSRL/HIMAC capabilities.
- **Operational Focus:** Emphasis on procedural mitigations (storm shelters, EVA scheduling) complements physical shielding due to mass limitations on Angara launchers.

## 5. Monitoring Future Opportunities

1. **zakupki.gov.ru:** Filter by customer “ГК Роскосмос” and keywords `радиационной защите`, `ОРЁЛ`, `РОСС`.
2. **Roscosmos Press Releases:** Announce major contracts and milestones, particularly around Oryol and ROSS development.
3. **TsNIIMash / IBMP Publications:** Technical journals such as *Kosmonavtika i Raketostroenie* and *Aviakosmicheskaya i Ekologicheskaya Meditsina* publish research outputs.
4. **International Forums:** Presentations at IAC and GLEX provide insight into ongoing shielding concepts despite limited tender transparency.
