# JAXA Radiation Shielding Initiatives and Funding Landscape

This document outlines radiation shielding projects and procurement mechanisms associated with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Insights come from JAXA open solicitations, joint NASA/JAXA mission documentation, and academic collaborations updated through late 2024.

## 1. Governance and Procurement Framework

- **Directorates:** The Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate (JAXA JST) oversees Kibo/ISS operations and Lunar exploration contributions. The Space Exploration Center (JSEC) coordinates Artemis/Gateway activities with NASA.
- **Funding Instruments:**
  - **Research Announcements (RA):** JAXA issues open RAs for academia and industry (e.g., "Research and Development for Lunar Surface Technology").
  - **Young Researcher Grants / Open Laboratory Programs:** Support material science and radiation detection research via university collaborations.
  - **International Agreements:** Contributions to the Artemis program and Gateway modules (I-HAB, HTV-X logistics) include cost-sharing and joint developments for shielding.
  - **J-SPARC (Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation):** Public-private partnerships fostering space technology commercialization, including materials and sensors.
- **Procurement Portal:** Public tenders listed on JAXA's “Chotatsu (procurement) information” site; typically in Japanese with requirements for domestic registration.

## 2. Completed and Ongoing Projects

### 2.1 Kibo Module Dosimetry Campaigns

- **Projects:** ISS experiments "Area PADLES," "Dosepix," and "D-SEND" integrating passive dosimeters across Kibo to map radiation fields.
- **Results:** Created comprehensive dose distribution datasets supporting JAXA’s radiation environment model (J-SPACE) and improved EVA planning for JAXA astronauts.

### 2.2 Lunar Gateway (International Habitation Module) Contributions

- **Partners:** ESA (prime), JAXA providing Environmental Control and Life Support subsystems and internal outfitting with strong shielding focus.
- **Scope:** Joint JAXA-ESA studies (2019–present) optimize multilayer shielding, water storage integration, and distributed dosimetry within I-HAB. JAXA's Environmental Control System team leads water-wall design trades.
- **Deliverables:** Preliminary design data shared at IAC and Gateway Technical Interchange Meetings; shielding concepts align with NASA/ESA requirements for 30–60 day crewed stays in lunar orbit.

### 2.3 HTV-X Logistics Vehicle Enhancements

- **Objective:** Upgrade HTV-X cargo module to support Gateway resupply and potential storm shelter mass augmentation.
- **Activities:** JAXA contracted Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) to evaluate polyethylene-based liner kits compatible with HTV-X pressurized cargo module; testing includes radiation transport modeling via PHITS (Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System).

### 2.4 Lunar Surface Technology Demonstration Grants

- **Programs:** JAXA RA (2021–2024) funded studies on regolith-based construction, water-ice resource utilization, and habitat concepts.
- **Examples:** 
  - Tohoku University project on "Regolith Sintered Panels for Radiation Mitigation," demonstrating microwave sintering prototypes.
  - Shibaura Institute of Technology research on hydrogenated polymer composites for inflatable habitats.

### 2.5 J-SPARC Projects

- **Notable Partnership:** JAXA with Teijin Ltd. (2022–2024) investigating aramid fiber-reinforced polyethylene sheets (ARPE) combining micrometeoroid and radiation protection.
- **Outcome:** Produced 1 m² prototype panels; planned exposure tests at JAXA's Tsukuba Space Center and potential flight demonstrations on future HTV-X missions.

## 3. Present and Upcoming Opportunities

### 3.1 JAXA RA 2024: "Lunar Surface System Technology"

- **Focus Areas:** Habitat shielding (passive/operational), radiation-tolerant materials, in-situ construction methods.
- **Funding:** Up to ¥80M per project over 3 years; open to Japanese universities and industry partners.
- **Timeline:** Proposals closed September 2024; selected teams start FY2025.

### 3.2 Gateway Environmental Monitoring Payloads

- **Objective:** Develop compact active dosimeters and neutron spectrometers for the Gateway Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) contributions.
- **Status:** JAXA seeking collaborative proposals with universities and SMEs; deliverables include ground qualification units by 2026.

### 3.3 Artemis Surface Exploration: Pressurized Rover

- **Partnership:** Toyota-JAXA Lunar Cruiser project includes shielding requirements for EVA refuge capability.
- **Development:** Current Phase (2023–2028) features design of hydrogen-based fuel cell stacks and integrated shielding using lightweight composites and water storage. Risk reduction contracts let to Toyota-affiliated suppliers and Japanese research institutes.

## 4. Trends and Considerations

- **PHITS Modeling Leadership:** JAXA promotes the PHITS code for shielding analysis; solicitations often require experience with PHITS/Irradiation data.
- **Collaboration with Industry:** J-SPARC encourages co-investment, giving private companies opportunity to mature materials for eventual NASA/ESA missions.
- **Global Integration:** Radiation solutions must align with NASA/ESA standards for Gateway; cross-agency working groups harmonize requirements.
- **Human Health Research:** JAXA’s Space Biomedical Research Office collaborates with Japanese universities on radiobiology, ensuring shielding studies link to biological outcomes.
